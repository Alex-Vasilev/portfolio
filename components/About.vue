                <p> Hello! My name is Alex. I am 28 years old. I'm engaged in front-end development.
                    Now we are working with the guys to develop a cool callback widget
                    with CRM and analytics. Here I will keep a small blog, in which I
                    will describe interesting things that I will encounter in the process of work.
                    This site was made as a whole as an exercise. On the frontend I used Vue 2.x, 
                    the assembly is webpack, on the backend - nodeJS. As a database, I tried mongo. 
                    In the first articles, I'll briefly describe the process of creating a site with
                    a similar stack and what interesting things you'll have to meet if you want to do 
                    something like that.
                    I do not apply for the last instance and this information will be of a fact-finding character.
                    Therefore, here are my contacts and if you have an irresistible desire to discuss these
                    topics - write here or in the comments, I will be happy.</p>
