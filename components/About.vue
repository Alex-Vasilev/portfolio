        <p class="container">Hello! My name is Alex. I am 28 years old. I'm engaged in front-end development.
            Now we are working with the guys to develop a cool callback widget
            with CRM and analytics. Here I will keep a small blog, in which I
            will describe interesting things that I will encounter in the process of work.
            I do not apply for the last instance and this information will be of a fact-finding character.
            Therefore, here are my contacts and if you have an irresistible desire to discuss these
            topics - write here or in the comments, I will be happy.</p>
